| `23503` | Foreign Key | "Required data missing" | Sign out and back in |
| `42P01` | Missing Table | "Database not configured" | Contact support |
| `42501` | Permission | "Permission denied" | Verify account |
| `PGRST116` | Not Found | "Record doesn't exist" | Verify information |
| `23502` | Required Field | "Missing required info" | Fill all fields |

### 2. **Enhanced Error Display Component**

**Features:**
- ✅ **Visual Hierarchy** - Color-coded severity levels
- ✅ **Contextual Icons** - Instant visual recognition
- ✅ **Actionable Buttons** - Retry and copy error functionality

This information is already in use. Please use different details or contact support if you believe this is an error.

💡 Suggestion: Try using a different email address or student/employee ID.

🆘 Still having issues?
   Please contact support with the following information:
   - What you were trying to do: student profile creation
   - Error code: 23505
   - Time: 2024-10-03T14:30:15.123Z

[Try Again]  [Copy Error]
```

### 3. **Database Connection Testing**

**Pre-flight Checks:**
- Test database connectivity before operations
- Validate table access permissions
- Provide specific guidance if database is unavailable

**Benefits:**
- Catches configuration issues early
- Prevents confusing timeout errors
- Gives clear "system unavailable" messages

### 4. **Detailed Logging System**

**Grouped Console Logs:**
```typescript
❌ Error in Create Student Profile
   Error: duplicate key value violates unique constraint
   Code: 23505
   Details: Key (student_id)=(STU123) already exists
   Additional Info: {
     userId: "abc-123",
     studentId: "STU123",
     attempts: 1
   }
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy debugging in development
- Quick issue identification
- Detailed context for support

### 5. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**

**Smart Retries:**
- Automatically retries network/timeout errors
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s...)
- Maximum 3 attempts
- User-friendly progress indication

**Retryable Errors:**
- Network connection failures
- Request timeouts
- Temporary database unavailability
- Connection exceptions

### 6. **Required Field Validation**

**Pre-submission Checks:**
- Validates all required fields are filled
- Provides specific list of missing fields
- Prevents unnecessary server requests
- Clear error messages

**Example:**
```
Please fill in the following required fields: firstName, studentNumber
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **For Developers:**

1. **Always Use Error Handler:**
   ```typescript
   try {
     // operation
   } catch (error) {
     logDetailedError('Context', error, additionalInfo);
     const parsed = parseSupabaseError(error, 'context');
     return { success: false, error: formatErrorForUser(parsed) };
   }
   ```

2. **Provide Context:**
   ```typescript
   logDetailedError('Create Student Profile', error, {
     userId: user.id,
     studentId: studentId,
     major: major
   });
   ```

3. **Test Error Paths:**
   - Test each error scenario
   - Verify user-friendly messages
   - Check retry functionality
   - Validate logging output

### **For Users:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully:**
   - Main message explains what went wrong
   - Suggestions tell you what to try
   - Troubleshooting helps if stuck
