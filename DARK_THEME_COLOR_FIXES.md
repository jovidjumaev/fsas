# Dark Theme Color Fixes ‚úÖ

## üéØ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
The professor portal pages had overly bright and harsh colors in the stats cards when viewed in dark mode, making them difficult to read and visually uncomfortable.

## üîß **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **Color Strategy Changes:**
- **Before**: Bright gradient backgrounds with intense colors in dark mode
- **After**: Subtle slate-based backgrounds with muted colors for better readability

### **Specific Changes Made:**

#### **1. Background Colors**
- **Before**: `dark:from-blue-900/20 dark:to-blue-800/20` (bright blue gradients)
- **After**: `dark:from-slate-800/50 dark:to-slate-700/50` (subtle slate gradients)

#### **2. Text Colors**
- **Before**: `dark:text-blue-400` (bright blue text)
- **After**: `dark:text-slate-300` (muted slate text for better contrast)

#### **3. Number Colors**
- **Before**: `dark:text-blue-100` (bright blue numbers)
- **After**: `dark:text-white` (clean white numbers for maximum readability)

#### **4. Icon Colors**
- **Before**: `text-blue-500` (bright blue icons)
- **After**: `text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400` (muted blue icons in dark mode)

#### **5. Border Colors**
- **Before**: `dark:border-blue-700` (bright blue borders)
- **After**: `dark:border-slate-600` (subtle slate borders)
