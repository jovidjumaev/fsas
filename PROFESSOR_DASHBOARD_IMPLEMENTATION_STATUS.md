## 📝 Notes for Development

### Mock Data
Currently using mock data in the dashboard. Replace with actual API calls when ready:

```typescript
// TODO: Replace mock data
const fetchDashboardData = async () => {
  // Use actual Supabase queries
  const { data: classes } = await supabase
    .from('classes')
    .select('*')
    .eq('professor_id', user.id);
  
  // Calculate actual stats
  // Fetch real sessions
  // etc.
};
```

### State Management
- Currently using React useState
- Consider Context API for shared state
- Real-time subscriptions for live data

### Error Handling
- Add toast notifications for errors
- Implement retry logic
- Graceful degradation
