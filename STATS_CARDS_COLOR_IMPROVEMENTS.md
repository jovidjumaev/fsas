# Stats Cards Color Improvements ‚úÖ

## üéØ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**
The grey colors in the stats cards across analytics, students, and sessions pages were too bland and didn't fit well with the overall design aesthetic. The user specifically mentioned not liking the grey color and wanting something more fitting.

## üîß **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **New Color Strategy:**
Instead of the bland grey (`dark:from-slate-800/50 dark:to-slate-700/50`), I implemented a more vibrant and fitting color scheme that uses the actual brand colors with subtle dark mode variants.

### **Color Changes Made:**

#### **1. Students Page Stats Cards**
- **Total Students**: Blue theme with `dark:from-blue-900/30 dark:to-blue-800/30`
- **Active Students**: Emerald theme with `dark:from-emerald-900/30 dark:to-emerald-800/30`
- **Avg Attendance**: Amber theme with `dark:from-amber-900/30 dark:to-amber-800/30`
- **Total Enrollments**: Indigo theme with `dark:from-indigo-900/30 dark:to-indigo-800/30`

#### **2. Analytics Page Stats Cards**
- **Total Sessions**: Blue theme with `dark:from-blue-900/30 dark:to-blue-800/30`
- **Total Students**: Emerald theme with `dark:from-emerald-900/30 dark:to-emerald-800/30`
- **Avg Attendance**: Amber theme with `dark:from-amber-900/30 dark:to-amber-800/30`
- **Top Performing**: Indigo theme with `dark:from-indigo-900/30 dark:to-indigo-800/30`

#### **3. Sessions Page Active Alert**
- **Active Sessions Alert**: Emerald theme with `dark:from-emerald-900/30 dark:to-emerald-800/30`
