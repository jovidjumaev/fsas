## 🔍 Run Tests Yourself

### Option 1: Full Test (Recommended)
```bash
node test-notification-system.js
```
**Tests:** Table existence, notification creation, RLS, mark as read, multiple types

### Option 2: Trigger Test
```bash
node test-notification-triggers.js
```
**Tests:** Automatic notifications when attendance marked or sessions activated

## ✅ What Students Receive Notifications For

### Automatic (via Database Triggers):
1. ✓ **When their attendance is marked**
   - Present → Low priority (gray)
   - Late → Medium priority (blue)
   - Absent → High priority (red)

2. 📅 **When a class session becomes active**
   - All enrolled students get notified
   - "QR code is now available"
   - High priority (orange)

### Manual (via API/Professor):
3. 📢 **Announcements** from professors
4. ⏰ **Assignment due date reminders**
5. ❌ **Class cancellations**
6. 🔄 **Class rescheduling**
7. 📝 **Grade postings**
8. ⚙️ **System notifications**

## 💡 Quick Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Test Manual Notification
```javascript
// Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via API
INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, type, title, message, priority)
VALUES (
  'your-student-user-id',
  'announcement',
  'Test Notification',
  'This is a test. You should see this in your notification panel!',
  'high'
);
```
**Expected:** Student sees notification immediately in bell icon

### Scenario 2: Test Attendance Trigger
```sql
-- 1. Make sure student is enrolled in a class
-- 2. Create or activate a session
-- 3. Mark attendance:
INSERT INTO attendance (student_id, session_id, status, scanned_at, device_fingerprint, ip_address)
VALUES (
  'student-user-id',
  'session-id',
  'present',
  NOW(),
  'test-device',
  '127.0.0.1'
);
```
**Expected:** Student automatically receives "Attendance Marked" notification

### Scenario 3: Test Session Activation Trigger
```sql
-- 1. Ensure students are enrolled in the class
-- 2. Activate a session:
UPDATE sessions
SET is_active = true
WHERE id = 'session-id';
```
**Expected:** All enrolled students receive "Class is Now Active" notification

## 🎯 Why Students Might Not Get Notifications

### Common Issues:

1. **Not Enrolled in Class** ⚠️
   - Check: `SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE student_id = 'user-id' AND status = 'active';`
   - Fix: Enroll student in class

2. **No Active Sessions** ⚠️
   - Check: `SELECT * FROM sessions WHERE is_active = true;`
   - Fix: Create and activate a session

3. **Foreign Key Issues** ⚠️
   - Attendance must reference correct `student_id` (user_id, not student number)
   - Sessions must reference valid `class_id`

4. **Browser Notifications Blocked** 🔕
   - Students need to allow browser notifications
   - Check browser settings

---

## 📊 Monitor Notifications

### Check Recent Notifications:
```sql
SELECT 
  n.created_at,
  u.email,
  n.type,
  n.title,
  n.is_read
FROM notifications n
JOIN users u ON n.user_id = u.id
WHERE n.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY n.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Unread Notifications:
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  COUNT(*) as unread_count
FROM notifications n
JOIN users u ON n.user_id = u.id
WHERE n.is_read = false
GROUP BY u.email
ORDER BY unread_count DESC;
```

### Check Trigger Status:
```sql
SELECT tgname, tgrelid::regclass as table_name
FROM pg_trigger 
WHERE tgname LIKE '%notification%';
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No notifications showing up"
**Solution:**
1. Check if notifications exist: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications WHERE user_id = 'user-id';`
2. Check if RLS is blocking: Try with service role key
3. Verify user is logged in correctly

### Issue: "Automatic notifications not being sent"
**Solution:**
1. Verify triggers exist (see query above)
2. Check if student is enrolled in the class
3. Verify foreign key relationships are correct
4. Check Supabase logs for trigger errors

### Issue: "Real-time updates not working"
**Solution:**
1. Check if Realtime is enabled in Supabase (Publications)
2. Verify WebSocket connection in browser console
3. Make sure notifications table has Realtime enabled
