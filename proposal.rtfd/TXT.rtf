\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Project Proposal
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Background. Attendance is at the core of teaching at Furman University, particularly in terms
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 of student engagement. Furman University\'92s professors place significant value on students\'92 active
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 participation in class, and almost every class has attendance and participation grading in its syllabus.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 As a senior student in the Computer Science Department, taking non-CS classes for General Course
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Requirements, I realized how almost every professor on campus uses manual labor in terms of
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 ensuring students are present in class by taking notes in their notebooks at the beginning of every
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 class throughout the entire semester. This process is slow and is prone to mistakes, as well as
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 compromising valuable lecture time for professors. I have heard many students complain about
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 their participation and attendance grades at the end of the semester, when the memory fades away.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Therefore, I realized that it would be great to create a system that would streamline this process,
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 which would allow professors not to have to worry about taking attendance, as the students are the
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 ones who would be responsible for marking themselves as present by scanning the QR code at the
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 beginning of every class. The system would put an automatic timestamp on students\'92 attendance as
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 well as classify whether they were present on time, late, or absent. Researchers suggest a "strong
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 relation between digital attendance and improved student performance, with increased punctuality,
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 interaction, and class participation." [ 1 ] This motivates me to create FSAS to smooth the process of
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 marking students\'92 attendance.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Goal. The goal of this project is to build an FSAS that would streamline the process of recording
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 students\'92 attendance and improve punctuality and student engagement. The system will take advantage
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 of QR codes displayed at the beginning of every class, which would mark the attendance through
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Single Sign On Furman student account, as well as follow up with the confirmation code. According to
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 the article Enhancing Attendance Tracking Efficiency and Effectiveness through the Implementation
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 of a QR Code-Based System, "QR code technology significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 of attendance tracking, with mean scores ranging from 3.66 to 3.75." [ 2 ] To ensure fool-proof, I
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 am planning to have a rotating QR code that changes every 30 seconds, as well as a connection
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 to FU-Student to ensure proximity in terms of location. It could later be expanded into exploring
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 features like data analytics for professors to engage with at the end of the semester, and the OpenAI
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 API to answer questions that the professor might have about a specific student\'92s attendance or general
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 trends.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Data. Since the project focuses on classroom attendance, the data will be collected through the
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 system, as it will be used in the first testing classes. The records will be under the course sections and
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 would include authentication with Furman Login, timestamp of the scan, classification of timestamp
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 (on time, late, or absent).
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Methods. FSAS is going to be a web-based application that would take advantage of tools like React
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 or Next.js for the fronend development. In the backend, FSAS will use Superbase for authentication
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 and data storage, since it is user-friendly and accessible. The QR codes that are going to be generated
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 by the professors at the beginning of the class can be displayed with no hesitation, as they will be
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 rotating every 30 seconds and will be valid for scanning once per device, to ensure fool-proof and
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 avoid students sharing the QR code with their absent friends. Optionally, I could integrate a feature
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Furman CSC-475 Seminar in Computer Science
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 that would allow students to request or excuse an absence with pending approval from the professor.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 I will also include the Export feature, allowing professors to get data in CSV and Excel formats.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Evaluation. When it comes to evaluating FSAS, I will plan to take advantage of both quantitative
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 and qualitative measures. I will simultaneously run multiple classes happening at the same time,
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 test whether multiple devices can sign in at the same time, and make sure the database stores all
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 the quantitative information under the correct tables (courses section). When it comes to measuring
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 success, it is also important to measure the time it takes for a student to mark themselves as present.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Ideally, the project would aim to work within 60 seconds, which would require the professors to
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 give a 3-minute grace period at the beginning of the class, until students get used to this new system.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Long-term, a survey can be conducted that would ask professors and students about their experience
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 in terms of the effectiveness of this product and room for improvement.
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 Dissemination. The project will be entirely available in my GitHub account with all of its source
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 code, excluding sensitive information, to ensure data integrity. At the end of the semester, a project
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 poster will be created and presented to the entire CS Department. In April 2026, the project will be
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 presented at Furman Engaged with the demo to the entire Furman community, and feedback would be
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 appreciated. For the project report, I am planning to use LaTeX, to be submitted for review, and the
\f1\fs24 \

\f0\fs29\fsmilli14667 link to the LaTeX file will also be available on GitHub. Moreover, the entire project will be displayed
\f1\fs24 \
